## Database Architecture 

<details>
<summary>Database Architecture</summary>


The ERD ([available here](#appendix)) shows two main concepts: the user and the quizzes. Within each, each model is designed to handle quizzes with individual questions, answers and user scores for users to track their progress, and for admins to track user success rates for future features. This modular approach ensures that each model handles its data in a self-contained manner, ensuring future scalability and ease of custom database queries where necessary for future development. 



## Database Design and Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The application's database design follows a modular approach, centered around two core entities: Users and Quizzes. This architecture ensures a clear separation of concerns, allowing each entity to handle its respective data in a self-contained and scalable manner.

The ERD illustrates the relationships between these entities and their associated models:


### User Entity

The User entity encompasses models responsible for managing user accounts, authentication, and progress tracking. Key models include:

- **User**: Stores user profile information, such as name, email, and credentials.
- **UserProgress**: Tracks individual user performance, including quiz attempts, scores, and overall progress.

This modular design allows for planned future enhancements, such as implementing user roles, permissions, and gamification elements like leaderboards or achievement badges.

### Quiz Entity

The Quiz entity is comprised of models dedicated to managing quizzes, questions, and answer options. Key models include:

- **Quiz**: Represents a collection of questions.
- **Question**: Stores the question text and associated metadata.
- **Answer**: Holds the answer options for each question, including the correct answer.

This separation of concerns facilitates future scalability, enabling features like dynamic quiz generation for personalised user progression plans based on topics needing most improvement, question randomization, and advanced analytics for question performance and difficulty analysis.
